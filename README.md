# Vulcan
Vulcan is an Undergraduate research project at the University of West Florida. The purpose of this project is to research, design, and create a workable Navigation Mesh for muiltiple environments that can be used to compare intelligent Search Algorithms. The end product will hopefully work on multiple environments and will not need any pre built paths or information. This project is being built inside Unity 5 and the code for the both the Navigaiton Mesh and the Search Agent will be writted using C#. The assests of the environment and character models is taken from a free open-source project called survival shoot tutorial that can be found at http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-project.
